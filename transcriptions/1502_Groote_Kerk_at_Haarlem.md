Fitzwilliam inherited a number of Dutch paintings from his maternal grandfather and he added to this collection throughout his life this is one of the best Dutch canvases that he acquired himself.

It's a view dating from around 1665 of the Main Square in Haarlem, painted by Gerrit Berckheyde. We're looking out from the portico of the town hall, across the meat and fish market towards the towering Cathedral of Saint Bavo - the pride of Haarlem's skyline.

This great church was described in a 17th century poem as:

"That big barrel, praised in the whole country. Such a beautiful and daring building as ever a church was made. A credit to the Town, and miracle of the Country, and almost a greater work than any made by human hands."

The Cathedral is a favourite subject of Berckheyde, who painted it more than thirty times in his career. Fitzwilliam also bought a matching panel by the same artist which depicts the town hall of Amsterdam.
