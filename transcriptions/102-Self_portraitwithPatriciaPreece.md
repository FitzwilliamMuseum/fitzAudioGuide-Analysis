Stanley Spencer likened his method of painting Patricia Preece, the woman in this painting, to an ant crawling over her body. Look at the creases in her flesh here: the sharply protruding pelvic bone, the brilliantly observed range of skin tones; this is an almost unsettlingly forthright depiction of a naked body. But if this detail suggests a physical intimacy between the artist and his model, there seems to be at the same time an emotional gulf between the couple who are shown.

Preece's face wears a bored, disappointed expression. Her eyes are unfocused and vacant. While the man, Spencer himself, gazes at her. Not much happier, one feels, than she.

The sheets are crumpled. He's but there’s little sense of fulfilment. Spencer painted this canvas in 1937.

In May of that year he married Patricia Preece only four days after his divorce from his first wife Hilda had been finalized. In fact, Spencer had always fantasized about having two wives.

Here’s the Fitzwilliam’s former director, Duncan Robinson:

“To begin with, at least, he had no intention of giving up on his wife or his first marriage and he contemplated bigamy with a complete sort of equanimity. He thought it was the most natural thing in the world to have two women, not one. He rather surprised that neither of them liked the idea.”

‘Desire is the essence of all that is holy’, Spencer once wrote, and he sought
his love for Hilda and Patricia as somehow sacramental. Here he kneels before the prone figure of his second wife, like a communicant at an altar.
