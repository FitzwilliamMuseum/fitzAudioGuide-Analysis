Greek coin specialist Evie Marku "The silver tetradrachm of Naxos is one of the masterpieces the ancient world. Naxos was founded by Greek settlers coming from Chalcis in 735 BC It was one of the first cities of Sicily that started issuing coins."

On the obverse, the heads side of the coin you can see on your screen, is Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, a lavishly bearded male with an ivy wreath around his head. On the other side, a brilliantly depicted naked satyr or Silenus crouches down, a kantharos wine cup in his hand.

Evie Marku:

"Naxos was well known for producing wine in the antiquity, and the fact that the face of the Dionysus is combined with one of his followers, Silenus, on the reverse, preparing to drink wine from a kantharos, is a very important element, proving the importance of wine for the colony of Naxos and this one is important because the residents of Naxos in 476 were actually removed from their city to Lentini, another Sicilian city by the tyrant of Syracuse, Hieron the first.

Fifteen years later when the tyrant was deposed they were permitted to come back home. This coin stated in this period, in 460, and it was probably issued to celebrate this very important event for the city.
