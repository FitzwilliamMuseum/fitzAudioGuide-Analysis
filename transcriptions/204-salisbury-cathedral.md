Salisbury Cathedral, provided Constable with one of his greatest man-made subjects. Although, here, he's depicted it from an unusual angle and subordinated it to its natural surroundings.

The tall grey spire is all that is visible of the huge magnificent thirteenth-century structure and even this is almost pushed from the canvas by the trees.

In the foreground a small stone bridge crosses a stream probably that would empty the Bishop's fish pond into the River Avon.

Constable first stayed in Salisbury in 1811 and it is there that he met that man who is to become his greatest friend, the Reverend John Fisher, nephew of the then Bishop.
