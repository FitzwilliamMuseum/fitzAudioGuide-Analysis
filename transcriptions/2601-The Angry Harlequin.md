The Commedia dell'arte was a form of theatre that originated on the streets of Italy in the 16th century. It became popular throughout Europe, not least at the Saxony court.

Many of the stock characters are still familiar today: Harlequin, for instance, with his distinctive lozenge-patterned clothes; his flirtatious sweetheart Columbine 'Pulcinella', familiar to the English in his incarnation as 'Mr. Punch'.

This figure depicts Harley Quinn, in angry mood, know for his agility, here adopts a characteristically exaggerated pose. Comparatively unusual for a Meissen figure is the emphasis on Harlequin's ugliness here.

His lips are turned down in a petulant scowl, and his bushy eyebrows and large black facial wart do little to endear him. Harlequin's ambiguous character is set forth in the following description by an 18th-century writer:

'He is a mixture of stupidity, naivet√©, wit, clumsiness, and grace. He is an overgrown boy with occasional glimmers of intelligence and his mistakes and blunderings often have wayward charm.

His role is that of the faithful manservant: always patient, gullible and greedy. He is always amorous and is forever getting himself or his master into trouble. He is hurt and comforted as easily as a child and his grief is visible.
