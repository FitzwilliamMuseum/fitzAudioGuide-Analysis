This pot dates from around 480 BC and can be seen in case 16: 'Women in Ancient Greece'. It's decorated with a figure of a female warrior warrior called an "Amazon".

Mary Beard of the Cambridge University Classics Faculty:

"In the misogynistic culture of classical Greece, one of the worst nightmares was the idea of the "Warrior Woman", and in fact, there was a whole myth of a tribe of female fighters who lived on the margins of the Greek world and eschewed men entirely, that had all sorts of entrancingly weird customs.

They were supposed to cut off one of their breasts in order to use bows and arrows more comfortably, and if ever they had male children, they of course got rid of them smartly, and in fact they used to just kidnap men briefly in order to father these kids.

The point about the Amazons, though, is not that they're ever in the end successful. Time and again, these warrior women are conquered by upstanding Greek men and Greek heroes, people like Herakles and Theseus repeatedly make sure that Greek manhood is victorious over these women, and indeed Theseus himself manages to take the queen of the Amazons, Hippolyta, to be his bride, which of course puts the Amazons' aspirations.
