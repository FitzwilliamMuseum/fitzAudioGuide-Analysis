This elegant vessel is called a kundika, or chongbyong. It's a water sprinkler that was originally used in Buddhist ceremonies which by the 12th century, when this one was made, had come to be used in everyday life for storing liquid.

The small spout on the body would originally have had a hinged lid and it was through this aperture that the kundika was filled.

The water was then poured out from the slender spout at the top. The shape is derived from Chinese metal vessels, but it originated ultimately in India.

Beneath the semi-translucent green glaze of this vessel, you can see delicately incised motifs drawn from the natural world. Look at the lotus petals on the neck and see if you can make out the clouds with cranes flying among them lower down.

The body itself is covered with willow trees on one side and reeds on the other. More lotus flowers are dotted around, and amongst this foliage are ducks, cranes, and geese.
