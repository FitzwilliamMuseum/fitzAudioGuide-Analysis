The decoration of many Greek vases reflects their use at the Symposium, the
Greek drinking party. The painted amphora takes wine-drinking as its central
theme. And though it deals with divine and mythological figures, it also
tells us a fair amount about the human symposium. Guests at an Athenian
symposium were always male, but the are sometimes accompanied by courtesans.

Dionysus is shown here with his lover, the Cretan princess Ariadne. Her flesh is
depicted in white, as was the custom for women on black figure pots. In an
ancient account of a symposium, the Greek writer Xenophon describes how the
guests watched a short erotic mime about Dionysus and Ariadne which so inflamed
them that most cantered home immediately to make love to their wives, all those that were unmarried swore
that they would find a mate.
