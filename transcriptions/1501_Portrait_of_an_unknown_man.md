When the Fitzwilliam Museum acquired portrait by Frans Hals in 1879 it looked rather different. A previous owner painted over the background in brown paint, and obliterated the sitter's great black broad brimmed hat.

Although he was appreciated in his own lifetime particularly in his native Haarlem, Hals' rough spontaneous style found few admirers until the late 19th Century, when he was rediscovered not least by Vincent Van Gogh.

"What a joy to see a Frans Hals," he wrote, two centuries after the artist's death. "How different from those pictures where everything has been carefully smoothed down in the same way."

Art Historian Julia Tozer considers what Van Gogh might have appreciated about this particular work by his fellow countryman:

"I think one of the things he would have absolutely loved about this portrait was that Hals was celebrating his own people in a way that Van Gogh also was to do, he was to go on to to paint portraits of people whose lives would otherwise have been unrecorded.

And there's something about the man in this painting, with his tousled hair and his jaunty hat and so on and his very very lived in face that transcends time he does seem to live and breathe in front of us and we're right back with him somehow and that immediacy, was something van Gogh wanted too."
