This terracotta figure was made by French sculptor Louis François Roubilliac as a model for a life-sized marble statue of the composer George Frederic Handel, but it's really a remarkable piece of sculpture in its own right.

For a model, the quality of the modelling and the attention to detail is extraordinary. You can see the veins and fingernails of the composers hand as he plucks a note from his lyre.

His right foot has fallen free from its slipper and his toes are visible, pressing against the thin fabric of his stockings there's a strong sense here that we are witnessing Handel at home.

His gown is loose, the buttons of his breeches are undone, and there's a look of concentration on his face of alertness. Are we perhaps witnessing an intense, fleeting moment of inspiration? A putto at his feet transcribes the notes that he plays.

In spite of this informality this is, in fact, a model for a public sculpture, one of few in England at the time to celebrate a living person other than the monarch Handel was a huge celebrity in mid-eighteenth century London and the finished marble was the artistic centrepiece of the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens on the south bank of the Thames.

Contemporary visitors to this pleasure resort were often startled by the sculpture’s realism and Roubilliac was likened to Pygmalion, the mythical Greek sculptor whose statue came to life.
