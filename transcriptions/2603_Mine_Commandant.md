This beautifully dressed figure with his long white wig and gold trimmed jacket is the commandant of a silver mine the leader of an important workforce in 18th century Saxony.

Miners that made a significant contribution to the discovery and manufacture of European porcelain, Kaolin, the white clay which was an essential ingredient, had been discovered in a mine only 50 miles southwest of Meissen.

A magnificent parade of 1,400 miners had been one of the highlights of the celebrations of the wedding of Augustus the Strong's son in 1719. And although they were not made until around 1750, this figure around it will probably created in memory of that event.

The miners are dressed in their ceremonial outfits rather than their working clothes. It was once believed that this was in fact a portrait of Augustus himself.

The initials "A. R." on his cap stand for Augustus Rex, Augustus the king, although these probably advertise the commandant's loyalty to the monarch rather than his identification with him.
