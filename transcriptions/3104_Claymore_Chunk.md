This is one of the few surviving examples of the true claymore, a two-handed cutting sword used in the Highlands of Scotland and by Scottish mercenaries in Ireland until the late 17th century.

The name comes from a Gaelic word meaning great sword and it was a brutally efficient weapon. As this eyewitness account of the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689 testifies.

"The enemy lay in heaps, so disfigured with wounds and so hashed and mangled, that even the victors could not look upon them without surprise and horror. Many had their heads divided into two halves by one blow.

Others had their skulls cut off above their ears. Their thick buff belts were not sufficient to defend their shoulders from such deep gashes, as almost disclosed at entrails.

Several pikes, small swords, and like weapons were cut quite through, and some that had worn skullcaps had them so beat into their brains that they died upon the spot.""

This was one of the last times the two handed Claymore was used in battle. The development of the firearm neutralised even this powerful weapon.
